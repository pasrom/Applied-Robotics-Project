# Applied-Robotics-Project
This is a project done in the course applied robotics. It's about a mobile roboter, which has a mounted camera on it. This camera is used to slam with [ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/pasrom/ORB_SLAM2) . The roboter is controlled by a differential drive and has a distance measurement, which is used for speed and pose determination. [ROS](http://www.ros.org)-Kinetic is used to bring all parts together. It is testet with Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2 LTS, both at the master and at the raspberry pi.

# Installation procedure

Run this procedure at the master computer and also at the raspberry pi. On the raspberry pi it will only install ROS and pigpio library and gopigo.

 1.  You need to create a folder named workspace in `~/`, for example
			
			mkdir ~/workspace
 2. clone this repo to your computer and to the raspberry pi
	 
		 cd ~/workspace
		 git clone https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project.git
		 cd Applied-Robotics-Project/installScripts
		 
 3. run `install.sh` to automatically install ROS and ORB_SLAM2 with all its dependencies.

		  ./install.sh

	maybe you have to make it executable first

		 chmod +x install.sh

 4. Go grab a :coffee:...

# Starting the publishers and subscribers
## Master
Following command is starting ORB_SLAM2, Camera republisher, rviz, roboter pose updater, map creator and rqt gui
	   
	   roslaunch fin_starter Master.launch
## Raspberry Pi
ssh into your raspberry pi.

**This has to be done the first time:**
	
   `$user` is your username, created at the raspberry pi. Also make sure, that therre is only **one** username, otherwise the script may fail.
	
	su root
	/home/$user/workspace/Applied-Robotics-Project/installScripts/add_bashrc.sh


----------


Starting the motor and the distance measurement

    su root
    rosrun motor_cpp motor_cpp
open again a ssh to your raspberry pi and start the camera and motor velocities publisher
   
    roslaunch fin_starter raspy.launch
#### IP-Address changing
If you want to change the IP-address of the master you can do it in this [script](https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project/blob/master/installScripts/setRosIp.sh). Here is the line:

	MASTER_IP=192.168.0.107

## Known Bugs

 **Make sure, that the environment variables are set correctly.**
 
 Your `~/.bashrc` should look similar like this (scrol to the end of the file):
 
	source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
	. ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	source ~/gopigo_ws/devel/setup.bash
	. ~/workspace/Applied-Robotics-Project/installScripts/setRosIp.sh
	export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:/home/roman/workspace/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS

Important is, that the line `export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=...` is at the end.

**Changed `~/.bashrc`**


After you added or changed a environment variable in `~/.bashrc` you have to start a new terminal to activate them.


 **Virtual Machine**
 
If you are using a virtual machine, make sure you turned of the 3D acceleration. Otherwise the ORB_SLAM2 will not work, because Pangoling throws an error.

**Not enough memory**


If building is throwing errors, first check if there is enough memory left. If not, run [this](https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project/blob/master/installScripts/createSwapfile.sh) script.

	sudo ./createSwapfile.sh
