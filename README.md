# Applied-Robotics-Project
This is a project done in the course applied robotics. It's about a mobile roboter, which has a mounted camera on it. This camera is used to slam with [ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/pasrom/ORB_SLAM2) . The roboter is controlled by a differential drive and has a distance measurement, which is used for speed and pose determination. [ROS](http://www.ros.org)-Kinetic is used to bring all parts together. It is testet with Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2 LTS, both at the master and at the raspberry pi.

This project debends on [ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/pasrom/ORB_SLAM2) and [fin_ws](https://github.com/pasrom/fin_ws). The following manual will lead you trough the installation procedure.

# Installation procedure

Run this procedure at the master computer and also at the raspberry pi. On the raspberry pi it will only install ROS and pigpio library and fin_ws. The standard password we used was 
```
fhv
```

 1. Maybe you need to install git first
	```
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install git
	```
 2.  You need to create a folder named workspace in `~/`, for example
		```
		mkdir ~/workspace
		```
 4. clone this repo to your computer and to the raspberry pi
	```
	cd ~/workspace
	git clone https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project.git
	cd Applied-Robotics-Project/installScripts
	```
 5. run `install.sh` to automatically install ROS and ORB_SLAM2 with all its dependencies.
	```
	./install.sh
	```
	maybe you have to make it executable first
	```
	chmod +x install.sh
	```
 6. Go grab :coffee: :coffee: :coffee: ...

# Starting the publishers and subscribers
## Master
First start the roscore
```
roscore
```
Following command is starting ORB_SLAM2, Camera republisher, rviz, roboter pose updater, map creator and rqt gui
```   
roslaunch fin_starter Master.launch
```
### Starting each package by hand
	
```
rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=/camera/image_raw raw out:=/camera/camera_eigen
rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Mono Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/Logitech640x480.yaml
rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Monosub2 20 1 10 -15 20 -10 0.55 0.50 1 5 0 0 1 75
roslaunch nav_behaviors nav_behaviors.launch
roslaunch fin_description fin_rviz.launch
```

## Raspberry Pi
ssh into your raspberry pi. If you use two raspberry pi's, one for motor control and one for camera streaming, open for each a seperate ssh.
```
ssh raspy@192.168.0.105
ssh raspy@192.168.0.106
```
**This has to be done the first time:**
	
   `$user` is your username, created at the raspberry pi. Also make sure, that therre is only **one** username, otherwise the script may fail.
```
su root
/home/$user/workspace/Applied-Robotics-Project/installScripts/add_bashrc.sh
```
----------

**Raspberry Pi 1**

Starting the motor, the distance measurement and motor velocities publisher
```
su root
roslaunch fin_starter raspyMotor.launch
```
**Raspberry Pi 2**

open again a ssh to your second raspberry pi and start the camera
starting fisheye camera:
```
su root
roslaunch fin_starter raspyCamFisheye.launch 
```
starting normal camera:
```
roslaunch fin_starter raspyCam.launch 
```

#### IP-Address changing
If you want to change the IP-address of the master you can do it in this [script](https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project/blob/master/installScripts/setRosIp.sh). Here is the line:
```
MASTER_IP=192.168.0.107
```

### Starting each package by hand

```
roslaunch video_stream_opencv camera.launch
roslaunch fin_description fin_interface.launch 
```

## Known Bugs

 **Make sure, that the environment variables are set correctly.**
 
 Your `~/.bashrc` should look similar like this (scrol to the end of the file):
```
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
. ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/fin_ws/devel/setup.bash
. ~/workspace/Applied-Robotics-Project/installScripts/setRosIp.sh
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:/home/roman/workspace/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS
```

Important is, that the line `export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=...` is at the end.

**Changed `~/.bashrc`**


After you added or changed a environment variable in `~/.bashrc` you have to start a new terminal to activate them.


 **Virtual Machine**
 
If you are using a virtual machine, make sure you turned of the 3D acceleration. Otherwise the ORB_SLAM2 will not work, because Pangoling throws an error.

**Not enough memory**


If building is throwing errors, first check if there is enough memory left. If not, run [this](https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project/blob/master/installScripts/createSwapfile.sh) script.
```
sudo ./createSwapfile.sh
```

**Camera starting throws error**

Unplug and plug in the usb camera connector.

**Not on this list**

# Installation Guide for Raspberry Pi
## Preparing the SD Card
This is a quick start guide to install the raspberry pi image on a SD card (mac).

	sudo diskutil list

search for the `/dev/diskX` entry

```
sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
sudo ddrescue -c 1Ki -v --force ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img /dev/rdisk2
```

Backup your SD with `ddrescue`

```
sudo ddrescue -c 1Ki -v --force /dev/rdisk2 ubuntu-mate-16.04.2_ROS.img
```

## Raspberry Pi startup

 1. Follow the instructions given on the screen
 2. Connect to the wifi
 3. At the dialog indow "Who are you"
	 check the following
	- [x] Log in automatically
	- [ ] Require my password to log in
 4. Reboot

# Steering the roboter with a Logitech Controller

With the Logitech Controller it is possible to send a twist message to the roboter. With the left **joystick** you steer the roboter, but you have to press the **LB** Button during steering. The **LB** Button also resets the trajectory, this means the controller has higer priority than the trajectory. The **RB** Button will reset the ORB SLAM2, the odometry of the roboter and also the scale factor of the published ORB SLAM2 messages.

# Camera Calibration

To calibrate the camera follow this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration) and this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/StereoCalibration) for stereo calibration.
It is good to calibrate the camera at the laptop or computer and **NOT** at the raspberry pi, because it is slow.
For the ORB SLAM2 there is one more step to do. You have to extract following values out of the `camera.yaml` file after calibration .
```
camera_matrix:
fx 0 cx
0 fy cy
0 0 1

distortion_coefficients:
d0 d1 d2 d3 0

.........
```
and insert these values in the `Logitech640x480.yaml` file located at `/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/Monocular/Logitech640x480.yaml`
```
%YAML:1.0

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Camera Parameters. Adjust them!
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Camera calibration and distortion parameters (OpenCV) 
Camera.fx: fx
Camera.fy: fy
Camera.cx: cx
Camera.cy: cy

Camera.k1: d0
Camera.k2: d1
Camera.p1: d2
Camera.p2: d3
Camera.k3: 0.0

.........
```

# Fishe Eye Camera
If you are using another fisheye camera with [libuvc-camera](http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera) you have to change two parameters in [this](https://github.com/pasrom/Applied-Robotics-Project/blob/9f0ce0b9605aa4ef1c9ed327676b5f6002fffc97/installScripts/2_environmentSetupRos.sh#L37) script. The `idVendor` and `idProduct` has to be changed (without the hex notation).
```
sudo echo SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05a3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="9230", MODE="0666" > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uvc.rules
```

 The `idVendor` and `idProduct` values you will get with the following command
```
lsusb -v
```
Search for your camera, coppy and paste the mentioned parameters.
